# Security

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in the NexaLayer SDK or related services, please report it responsibly:

1. **Do not** open a public GitHub issue.
2. Email security concerns to: **security@nexalayer.com** (replace with your actual contact).
3. Include a clear description, steps to reproduce, and impact if possible.
4. We will acknowledge receipt and aim to respond within a reasonable time.

## Security practices

- Never commit API keys, secrets, or tokens to the repository.
- Use environment variables or secure secret stores for credentials.
- Keep dependencies up to date; we use automated dependency checks where possible.

Thank you for helping keep NexaLayer and its users safe.
